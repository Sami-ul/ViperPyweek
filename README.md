# ViperPyweek
<hr>
This is a repository where the Vipers team collaborates for our pyweek project

## Setup
To setup venv in the project root folder run:
``````

To run venv:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # this will not work now as we haven't setup the repo yet since we can't code
```

When you add a new package please run (only inside venv):
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

```
